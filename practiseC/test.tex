 I have created this article as an example. The goal is to learn the \LaTeX{}. \\ Now note that I am going to change to the next paragraph.

This is the paragraph and not just a new line. Note that there is so \\ called `indentation'. Also note that when you give the quotation marks they \\ appear correct. Below is an equation(with the number)
\end{flushleft}
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \vec{x}}=\sin({\theta})
\end{equation}

\begin{flushleft}
{\normalsize But the following does not have a number (and note that I did not \\ use \textbackslash \bf{nonnumber} command)}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{center}
$\lim \limits_{x \rightarrow \infty} \int{x^2}{e^{\frac{x}{2}}}=0$
\end{center}

{(too many backets?)}

{Here is the text that is aligned to right!\\This is the new line on the right side.}
